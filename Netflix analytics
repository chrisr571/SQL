In this SQL file, I am querying a database that is holding Netflix data.  Additionally I am answering questions about said data.

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)

select count(*) 
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
where type like 'movie' ;

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 

select
 max(date(date_added)) from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" ;

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

select title 
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
order by title ASC ; 

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 

select 
a.director, b.title
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" a
left outer join "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" b
on a.show_id=b.show_id
where b.title = 'Bright Star' ;

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 

select title, release_year
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
where type= 'Movie'
order by release_year asc 
limit 1;
