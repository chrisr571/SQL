# For this project, I downloaded a Spotify dataset from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed some brief analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 

select artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity),avg(danceability),avg(energy) 
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
group by artist_name,track_name ;

#2. Second I determined the top 10 artist by popularity.

select artist_name,track_name,popularity 
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
order by popularity desc limit 10 ;

#3. Third I determined what the longest song was and who sang it.  For this query I used two different methods.

#Option 1
select artist_name,track_name, max(duration_ms) 
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata ;

#Option #2
select artist_name,track_name, duration_ms 
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
order by duration_ms desc limit 1; 

#4. Fourth, I determined what the shortest song was and by who.  Again I used two different methods to do so.
#Option #1
select artist_name,track_name, min(duration_ms) 
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata ;

#Option #2
select artist_name,track_name, duration_ms 
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
order by duration_ms asc limit 1; 

#5. Lastly, I wanted to see how many songs where in the top 50 by my two favorite artists.

select artist_name,track_name 
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata where artist_name = 'Bad Bunny' 
or artist_name= 'The Weeknd' 
group by artist_name,track_name;
