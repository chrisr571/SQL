#In this SQL file, I am querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and orders data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 

select count(orderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderID)=6 and orderID <>'' 
and orderID IS NOT NULL ;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

select count(orderID),product from BIT_DB.JanSales 
where length(orderID)=6 and orderID <>'' 
and orderID IS NOT NULL and Product = 'iPhone' ;

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

select distinct a.acctnum from BIT_DB.customers a 
inner JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales b
on a.order_id=b.orderID
where length(orderid)=6 and orderid<> 'Order ID' ;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

select price, product from BIT_DB.JanSales 
group by product 
order by price asc limit 1 ;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

select product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue 
from BIT_DB.JanSales 
group by product ;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

select product,sum(quantity), sum(quantity)*price as revenue 
from BIT_DB.FebSales where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

select Count( distinct b.acctnum),avg(quantity*price) as'avg_amount_spent' 
from BIT_DB.FebSales a 
left outer join BIT_DB.customers b 
on a.orderID = b.order_ID where a.quantity >2 
and length(orderid)=6 and orderid <> 'Order ID';
